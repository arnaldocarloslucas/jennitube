# I'm not developer!
Don't worry, the jennitube.exe executable for windows was created, just allowing windows defender not to point out as a virus and use it in peace of mind. It will actually download the songs for you, then create "changes", which reports you as a malicious agent.
## Praise, constructive criticism and comments are always welcome. Enjoy!
